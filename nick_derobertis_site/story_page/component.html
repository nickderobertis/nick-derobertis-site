            I was born and raised in Virginia and from an early age I realized
            I only had limited time on this planet. Since then I have sought
            every day to maximize my impact on the world and get the most
            enjoyment out of life.

            I am a strong believer in continuous learning, innovation, and open collaboration.
            When taking on a project, I always try to learn something new and
            usually develop some tools along the way. In trying to maximize my
            impact, I have open-sourced {{ embed(software_link, css_classes=['d-contents']) }} My hope is that
            the net productivity gain to the finance, data science, and web development industries
            from open-sourcing these tools will be far greater than the amount of
            work I could produce alone. If everyone agrees to collaborate openly
            rather than keeping tools or knowledge for themselves or teams then
            society will be much better off as a whole.

            Another reason for my focus on software and automation is
            because I believe we would gain much more understanding of
            finance if our research studies were consistently open
            and reproducible. Automation, open source software, and version control
            are the keys to this future. An empirical research project
            should be able to run from the raw data sources to the
            full analysis, publication, and presentation by executing a
            single line of code and this is how I structure all my projects.
            The code and data should be submitted along with a journal
            submission and the reviewer should reproduce the results and
            inspect the code and data. The issue is that our studies
            often require complex manipulations of data for cleaning,
            merging, aggregating, analyzing, and visualizing. A research project
            that completes all of its stages from raw data to publication and presentation,
            in well-organized, modular, readable code currently easily spans
            tens of thousands of lines of code. Asking someone who
            also needs to know statistics, econometrics, economic theory,
            visualization, writing, and presentation to learn the
            level of software engineering skill currently required to
            execute this is too much of a burden for most.
            To make our research reproducible, some empirical
            researchers need to put a greater focus on software
            which automates the more difficult parts of the process
            and share it openly with the world. Then research projects
            could be completed with far less code and be automatically
            reproducible. I hope to do my part towards this end while
            also completing research and teaching.

            I spend most of my time researching finance topics, teaching,
            and building these tools, but when I get some extra time I love
            to work with my hands and experience the outdoors. I have been
            maintaining our family's vehicles since 2009 and take any chance
            I can get to go hiking or camping.
