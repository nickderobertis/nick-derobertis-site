# Idempotent setup for the optional `llmlint` LLM-judge tier (oneharness + llmlint).
#
# Wired into the Claude Code SessionStart hook (.claude/settings.json) so web/cloud
# sessions can run `just lint-llm` / `just lint-llm-diff` with no manual steps; also
# safe to run by hand (`just setup-llmlint`) or from a terminal. Every step
# tolerates failure and the script always exits 0 — a flaky install must never
# break session startup.
#
# What it does, and why:
#   1. Installs the `llmlint` binary from PyPI via `uv tool`. `llmlint-cli` wraps
#      the prebuilt binary and depends on `oneharness-cli`, so one dependency
#      resolution fetches both wheels — no Rust toolchain and no github.com
#      reachability (works in restricted-egress sessions where PyPI is reachable).
#      `uv tool` links only the *requested* package's executable onto PATH, but
#      llmlint >= 0.3.17 finds `oneharness` beside its own binary in the tool venv —
#      so this one install is a complete setup; no separate oneharness install /
#      PATH entry. `--upgrade` bumps an older cached tool, honouring the floor below
#      (`just lint-llm-diff` needs the changed-file-scoped `--diff` and three-dot
#      `--diff-base` default; `just lint-llm-validate` needs the `validate` gate).
#   2. In a Claude Code session, persists PATH (so the freshly installed binary
#      resolves) into CLAUDE_ENV_FILE so later Bash calls inherit it.
#
# Harness selection: the committed `oneharness.toml` is in fallback mode (codex +
# gpt-5.5 primary, claude-code + opus-4.8 secondary), so llmlint runs the primary
# for a contributor with Codex authenticated and falls through to claude-code in a
# Claude Code session where codex is absent — no `ONEHARNESS_*` override needed
# (one would only clobber the fallback list). If your fallback order can't select
# the right harness for some environment, set ONEHARNESS_HARNESSES there.
# llmlint: ignore-file[tool_output_is_signal, boundary_inputs_validated] deliberate for a session-startup installer (see header): `set -e` is omitted so a flaky install can't abort the hook — the script owns its exit codes and always exits 0; success stays quiet while failures log-and-continue rather than block startup; and the toolchain is installed from PyPI (`uv tool install llmlint-cli`) whose wheels ship with Trusted Publishing + PEP 740 attestations, so no unvalidated external input is executed.

# Version floor, as a PyPI constraint (the `llmlint-cli` package version tracks the
# wrapped binary version). `uv tool install --upgrade` installs the newest release
# satisfying it; oneharness comes along transitively at a compatible version.
# llmlint >= 0.3.17 finds `oneharness` beside its own executable (so a lone
# `uv tool install llmlint-cli` works), gives the whole-tree default the composed
# llmlint.yml relies on (it omits `files.include`), restricts `--diff` to the
# changed files (skipping empty diffs) so `just lint-llm-diff` judges only the
# branch's changes, treats a plain `--diff-base <ref>` as three-dot/merge-base
# (0.3.15), and ships the deterministic `validate` gate — config structure +
# `llmlint: ignore` directives + fragment version bumps — that `just
# lint-llm-validate` runs with no model call (0.3.17).
